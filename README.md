# agonlight2-projetcs
Utilities for [agonlight2](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Retro-Computers/AgonLight2/open-source-hardware)

The projects are built with VSCODE AgDev on windows and binaries are provided, that you can put in the /mos directory of the SD-card. Version of MOS and VDP are, console8 MOS 2.10.1 and VDP 2.3.1 or above, not tested with previous versions.  

Currently the program uses the memory address 0x0B000 in the Makefile for AgDev and the program is placed in the `/mos directory`, in a future version of mos, you will be able to put them in the `/bin directory` by modifying the address 0x0B000 to 0x04000 on Makefile, you will need to recompile the program.  
I have done the updates but I may have forgotten some.  
If the program not work, put it to /bin directory and launch ot directly.

In some assembler routines I refer to mos_api.inc via a path relative to where your project is located.
Don't forget to change this path relative to where your source is located: `include '../../lib/libc/mos_api.inc'`  

>Default projet are on folder CEdev/AgExamples/ (MyProject/src, MyProject/bin)
