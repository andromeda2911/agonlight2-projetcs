## FASM SAMPLE CODE

Example of assembly code with the AgDev fasmg compiler.  
The fasmg assembler is a little different than the ez80asm or ZDSII syntax.  

**functioning:**  
Create an **src** directory and create your assembler file inside this directory, for example test.asm.  
Create a **bin** directory if it does not exist.  
compile the assembly program using the **asm.bat** file.  

```
Don't forget to change the CDEV_PATH environment variable in the asm.bat file which is the directory
where AgDev is located.
```

Command line : `asm test`  

The test.bin file will be created in the bin directory
